# Custom-Soundboard

üéõÔ∏è Custom Soundboard Builder
This is an interactive web application that allows users to create a personalized soundboard, assign sounds to keyboard keys, record sequences of sound events, and play them back like a DJ pad. It's perfect for podcasters, gamers, or anyone looking for a fun audio toy.
